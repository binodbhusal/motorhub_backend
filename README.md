<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

Follow these steps in order to run ruby code.

### Prerequisites

First, you need to ensure that you have Rails and Ruby installed on your computer.

### Setup

It varies depending on your operating system so here are some links to help you install it on [Windows](https://gorails.com/setup/windows/10) and on [Ubuntu](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#apt).

For MacOS run the following commands

```sh
  brew install rbenv ruby-build
  # Add rbenv to bash so that it loads every time you open a terminal
  echo 'if which rbenv > /dev/null; then eval "$(rbenv init -)"; fi' >> ~/.bash_profile
  source ~/.bash_profile

  # Install Ruby
  rbenv install 3.2.2 
  rbenv global 3.2.2 
  ruby -v
```

This example shows how to install Ruby 3.2.2, you can check to see if there is a newer version [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/releases/). Iy is also assumed that you have [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) already installed on your Mac.

### Usage

Before running the project, make sure you have Ruby and Rails installed on your system. You can refer to the [official Ruby on Rails installation guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) for instructions on how to install them.
Once you have ruby installed, [clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

First navigate to the project directory in your terminal:
```
  cd your-project-directory
```

Then install the required gems by running in the terminal:
```
  bundle install
```
Create the database by running:
```
  rails db:create
```
Run the database migrations to set up the database schema:
```
  rails db:migrate
```
Optionally, you can seed the database with initial data (if the project provides seed data) by running:
```
  rails db:seed
```
Start the Rails server:
```
  rails server
```
To see all API Endpoints available, in your preferred browser, navigate to:
```
  https://motorhubbackend-production.up.railway.app/api-docs/index.html
```

### Run tests
To run tests, run the following command in the terminal:
```
  rspec
```
